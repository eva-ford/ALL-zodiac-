Always focused on the greater good, they have an optimistic take on life and its challenges. Ruled more by the head than the heart, they reach for the stars when it comes to their personal endeavours. You can always count on Aquarius for great ideas and fun conversations, and they are always willing to lend a hand or an ear. In love and friendship, Aquarius is friendly, but it keeps others at a distance due to its detached nature. Friends and lovers can feel frustrated by their inability to build intimacy in their relationships. When Aquarius continues his quest for knowledge, he comes up with ideas ranging from brilliant to insane. Distinguish between the two and you're more likely to be accepted as an expert.</p>

A Pisces is rarely lonely when they are by themselves, and have an active imagination. Creative, Pisces love spending time reading, exploring or creating art or music, and understanding their emotions through art. Deeply intelligent, Pisces have a profound respect for the power of the human mind and often get lost in their thoughts.</p>

Social gatherings, especially with people the sign is not close to can be overwhelming for Cancers. They do their best with a small group of same-minded individuals. Rarely benefiting from close combat of anykinf, they are quick to avoid conflict, just as quick as they are to help others especially in times of need. Cancer signs may seem prickly and standoffish at first meeting, once they make the decision to become friends with someone, that person has a friend for life. Cancers thrive off harmony, and get a good look for creating strong intimate relationships with peers, significant others and family members. Cancers also love creating and find the need to have some sort of creative outlet, whether its painting, writing, dancing, or even just reading. <br> In romance, Cancer is a giving and hopeful lover who expects the same in return. They like to be blunt with their lover, and hates the “chasing game”. As they are deeply intimate, it is not uncommon for Cancers to fall in love after just a few days or weeks. A sudden decision for them can last a lifetime!</p>

                        <p class="lead">Represented as a symbol to lions, Leos are natural born leaders, dramatic, dominant, and self-confident. They are able to achieve anything they want in life, all they have to do is commit to the project. Dont let their dominance fool you, as they are warmhearted, in love with life, love to laugh and simply enjoy the little things in their life. Very confident individuals, they love themselves and would do anything to grow their ego, and are extremely self-aware. Their high standards come in good use when they interact with others. Always with their head high, they speak to others in respect and high standard. But when a Leo becomes too attached to their own achievements, others could turn away. </p>

Keeping their goals at the front-end of their mind, they wont let chaos get in the way. They can become obsessed with details, constantly worrying that they missed something important that they cannot fix, and may become overly critical and concerned about matters that no one else seems to care about. Never wanting to disappoint another person, they get easily offended when the smallest inconvience happens, like a last-minute cancellation. Virgos often get lost in the business of life, at times of difficulty, Virgos find themselves separating from loved ones, criticizing, and judging. Virgos are inspired by beauty, by outfits, nature, organization. They thrive when everything in their life is neat and “picture perfect”.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Libras are peaceful, fair, and love the company of others. Being an Air sign, along with Gemini and Aquarius, they get inspired by good works of literature, have a strong intellect, and have a keen mind. Libras live off of balance and symmetry, and justice and equality. They take the big-picture approach when trying to make their life the best that they can be. Libras get fixated on one thing, whether it's work, a partner, or a family member, and this can leave them unhappy and needing change. Although Libra appears self-confident to outsiders, they might struggle with insecurity and low confidence, especially as it relates to personal identity, which sometimes feels mutable. Love being around people, Libras also need time on their own, to understand who they are. When Libras fall in love, they fall hard, but when it is time to go, it's easy for Libra to detach themselves from the situation. </p>

Being impressive individuals when a challenge arises, Scorpios are fearless and resourceful. Even though Scorpios give off cool for you vibes, they are also known to be very calm and cool, looking mysterious and hard to figure out. A Scorpio has a deep understanding of the rules of the Universe, which gives them an advantage others don't realize exists. Scorpios are Water signs, just as Cancer and Pisces, and Water signs are said that they always fight dishonesty of any kind, so they have to learn how to manipulate others to understand their behavior and thoughts. These characteristics lead them to acquire strange behavior patterns that are related to their inner tendencies such as distrust and jealousy.

                        <p class="lead">  Sagittarius is an independent, adventurous, and strong-willed person. They often go away from the pack to explore the horizons by themselves. As natural-born leaders, they do what they want, regardless of what other people think. They have a deep understanding of one's self and loves to challenge their inner mind.  In search of meaning in life, Sagittarius is the traveler of the Zodiac. They like to wander around the world, motivated by their open minds and philosophical views.

Sagittarius is an extrovert, always optimistic, full of enthusiasm, and ready for changes. Sun signs tend to be mentally focused, but when they find grounding, they become able to translate their thoughts and visions into actions and circumstances that produce a tangible result.</p>

Anyways, extremely smart, hardworking individuals, Capricorn signs will always get what they set their mind to, in both personal and professional life. Capricorns love to succeed in all areas of life. They're great at climbing the corporate ladder, and can easily adapt to new roles.  Capricorns believe presentation is everything, and their homes are usually a real-life Pinterest board. A Capricorn sometimes is overly focused on what things look like, instead of how things feel, which could cause them to feel unsatisfied. Capricorns love their family and are keen on good traditions. They are very serious by nature and possess an inner state of independence that controls their personal and professional lives. They possess self-control and can control a large group of people that work for them at any given time, make plans that are both solid and realistic, and lead others with their leadership. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top solely on their experience and expertise.  </p>
